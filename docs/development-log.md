- Improved AM/PM handling and inference
- Better event title extraction
- Section-based organization by day
- Confidence scoring implementation

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `utils/AzureVisionClient.js` - Azure API client

- `utils/TextNormalizer.js` - Text correction utilities
- Updated App.js for event display

### Phase 6: Text Processing Refinement (Accuracy Improvements)
**Objective:** Enhance text recognition accuracy and event extraction

**Key Achievements:**
- Implemented comprehensive OCR error correction system
- Added timezone-aware date/time processing
- Created sophisticated text normalization pipeline
- Improved event validation and organization
- Added proper name preservation (e.g., "Rane")

**Technical Enhancements:**
- Device local timezone detection
- Enhanced header date range detection
- Improved time format handling (various AM/PM styles)
- Better handling of common OCR mistakes
- Section-based text processing

**Text Correction Features:**
- Common word corrections (dentist, school, practice)
- Time format normalization (9:00 vs 9:0 vs 9.00)
- Month/day name corrections
- Proper name preservation
- Event confidence scoring

### Phase 7: Architecture Refinement (Code Organization)
**Objective:** Improve code structure and processing accuracy

**Key Achievements:**
- Modified camera aspect ratio from 17:11 to 8.5:11 for single page
- Created section-based processing system
- Enhanced visual guides for two-column layout
- Improved event detection and validation
- Added comprehensive text normalization

**Structural Changes:**
- Updated overlay guides for header, events, and todos columns
- Implemented day-based section processing
- Added event sorting by time within sections
- Enhanced validation for time formats
- Improved proper name handling

**Current Architecture:**
- `App.js` - Main app flow and UI
- `PlannerCamera.js` - Camera with visual guides
- `utils/AzureVisionClient.js` - Azure API integration
